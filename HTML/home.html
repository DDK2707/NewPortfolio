            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm an avid reader, my favourite books being Wizard's First Rule by Terry Goodkind, the Heroes of Olympus series by Rick Riordan, and the Skulduggery Pleasant series by Derek Landy. I am also a self-proclaimed metalhead, and have started dabbling in making my own music. I spend much of my time
            behind a screen, and if I'm not there, then I'll be in the kitchen or working out. <br><br> 
            My interest in coding comes from my love of video games and all things related to the internet. I spend quite a large portion of my waking hours on the interenet,and the creativity and skills that goes into making the content that I consume 
            fascinates me.<br> <br>
            I would describe myself as respectful, open and accomodating. I am always ready to take on a challenge and to help anyone to the best of my ability. I work hard and can perform under pressure. I have a storied history of meeting deadlines:
            if I can create something up to standard within the deadline, then I will do it, but I will not hesitate to negotiate an extension if I do not believe that I can produce quality work before the deadline. <br> <br>
            I am introspective and observant by nature, and this sometimes comes across as antisocial behaviour. I don't initially feel comfortable in large groups, but will form strong bonds given time. I believe that I would be a great addition to 
            any team because of my calm demeanour and leadership qualities, as well as creative problem solving skills that I have honed during my studies and the current course at Life Choices Academy.
